My Adventure
Hi there! 
I created a little tool that changes inches into millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), or meters (m). I had fun making it because it helped me learn more about programming in C#, working with numbers, and using the command line to chat with the computer.

How This Thing Works (Hopefully..)
Using this tool is super easy. You just let it know the number of inches you're starting with, and it'll show you how long that is in mm, cm, or m. I made this using C#, a way to tell computers what to do, which you can use to build lots of different things.
